Just an app I'm writing for my parents.  They're getting older, so I'm writing something of the "I've fallen and I can't get up" variety.  Basically, short term goals are to create an app the pings the user every so often, and if the user doesn't answer the push notification, the app sends a text message to someone else, notifying them that they might be in trouble.

It's entirely under construction at this point.

It's headed toward Creative Commons.

It's free and it always will be.
